GitAuth-GH - Automatic GitHub Repository backup
-----------------------------------------------

GitAuth-GH makes the task of backing up your GitHub
repositories (both private and public) to another github
server automatic.

By leveraging {GitAuth, an open source git-over-ssh auth server}[http://github.com/brownbeagle/gitauth]
to do the heavy lifting, gitauth will automatically provide
an up-to-date read-only copy of your applications source code,
along with synchronized deploy and user keys. Look out
in the near future for a screencast introducing it!
